## Empirical Study


We present the first comprehensive study to characterize PPs in DL systems developed in TensorFlow and Keras and to assess existing approaches in tackling PPs. We collect 224 PPs from 210 StackOverflow posts, and manually analyze these PPs to answer four research questions:

- RQ1 Symptom: what are the symptoms of PPs?
 - RQ2 Root Cause: what are the root causes of PPs?
 - RQ3 Stage: what are the stages of introducing and exposing PPs?
 - RQ4 Assessment: how is the capability of existing performance analysis approaches in tackling PPs?

All 224 PPs with labelled symptoms, root causes and stages is available [here](https://github.com/DLPerf/DLPerf.github.io/tree/main/empirical_study/empirical_study.csv).

<!-- Our empirical study data could be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DLPerf/DLPerf.github.io/tree/main/empirical_study/empirical_study.csv).
It contains all 224 PPs extracted from 210 Stack Overflow Posts.
The "comment" column describes the part of the post where the PP originate from, espetially helpful for understanding of multiple PPs from the same post.-->
